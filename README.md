# Data-Mining-Regression-Analysis
### Data Mining and Regression Analysis Using Python

In this project, we download a dataset that is related to fuel consumption and Carbon dioxide emission of cars. Then, 
we split our data into training and test sets, create a model using training set, Evaluate our model using test set, 
and finally use model to predict unknown value.

**Data :**
**FuelConsumption.csv**

We have downloaded a fuel consumption dataset, FuelConsumption.csv, which contains model-specific fuel consumption ratings 
and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada.

**Data Source :** [Data Source] (http://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64)

**Environment Set up :**
*	Importing Needed packages

* Understanding the Data

*	 Data Exploration

* Visualize Data

* Creating train and test dataset
 
 ###About linear regression?
 
Linear Regression fits a linear model with coefficients B = (B1, ..., Bn) to minimize the 'residual sum of squares' 
between the independed x in the dataset, and the depended y by the linear approximation.

### We modeled : 
1. Simple Regression Model
2. Non-linear regression
3. Multiple Regression Model

**For each model we performed the following tasks :** 
* 	Train Data Distribution

* 	Modeling using sklearn package

*  Plot Output

*	 Evaluation : Evaluate model with test data

*	 Plot Output
